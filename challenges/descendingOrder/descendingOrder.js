//Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument
// and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits
// to create the highest possible number.

//Examples:
//Input: 42145 Output: 54421
//Input: 145263 Output: 654321
//Input: 123456789 Output: 987654321

function descendingOrder(n){
  let order = []
  //for loop to iterate through the numbers
  //num 1 = (n[0])
  //num 2 = (n[1])
  //if num 1 is higher than num 2, move it up the index or push it into the array, else push 2 into the array?
  //then return the array.join('')

  }
